# Tutorial Archive
This repository is essentially where I dump code written for any tutorials I've completed.
## Contents
1. [Node.js](https://github.com/rtasalem/tutorial-archive/tree/main/freeCodeCamp-nodejs-tutorial) and [Express.js](https://github.com/rtasalem/tutorial-archive/tree/main/freecodecamp-express-tutorial) - Full Course, an 8-hour [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/Oe421EPjeBE?si=Vm3B6BOYkkxuUst8) provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). The original source code for this tutorial is made available by freeCodeCamp, my code just contains extra comments and notes I wrote for my own understanding while following along with the tutorial.
2.  [Learn PostgreSQL Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners](https://github.com/rtasalem/tutorial-archive/tree/main/freecodecamp-postgresql-tutorial), a 4-hour [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/qw--VYLpxG4) provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). These are the SQL tables I used for the tutorial.
3.  [JavaScript Array Functions Practice](https://github.com/rtasalem/tutorial-archive/tree/main/javascript-array-functions-practice) - a practice repo created by [James Q Quick](https://github.com/jamesqquick) to learn JS array functions. These are my solutions to the worksheet found in [the original repo](https://github.com/jamesqquick/javascript-array-functions-practice). I also created a [fork](https://github.com/rtasalem/javascript-array-functions-practice) of this repo.
